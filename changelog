0.11.2.0

  * The new Chunk typeclass allows for some code sharing with Ed
    Kmett's parsers package: http://hackage.haskell.org/package/parsers

  * New function runScanner generalises scan to return the final state
    of the scanner as well as the input consumed.


0.11.1.0

  * New dependency: the scientific package.  This allows us to parse
    numbers much more efficiently.

  * peekWord8', peekChar': new primitive parsers that allow
    single-character lookahead.
